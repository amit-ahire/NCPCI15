            <p align="justify">
                <strong>"National Conference and Project Competition for Students in Computer Engineering and Information Technology"</strong>
                 is a annual national conference organized by the CSI Student Branch of 
                Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology, Pune. It aims to 
                provide a platform for undergraduate students to express their views and
                 share knowledge from different fields of technology. This year it will be held in the 
                institute on <b>14th March, 2015</b>. The conference will provide a 
                chance for students to showcase their technical work and 
                experimentation. It will encourage those students presenting their 
                papers on their mini-projects, final year projects and any 
                experimentation done by them. Even though it may not be state of the 
                art, the student's own experimentation will be highly appreciated. The 
                topics for the conference have been chosen based on the thrust areas of 
                research in academia and industry.
